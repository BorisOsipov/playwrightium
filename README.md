# Playwrightium

## The story
I like Java. I like [Selenium](https://selenium.dev/). I like [Selenide](https://selenide.org/).
But also I like [Playwright Java](https://playwright.dev/java/). But I want to use all (or almost all) features of 
Playwright and continue using Selenide syntax.

What should I do?

I developed Playwrightium.

In general this is implementation of WebDriver interface using Playwright. Sounds crazy but it's true.
